The "Classify POIs from the Enron Scandal" Machine Learning Project
===================================================================

Hello there. This is my Data Analyst Nanodegree Machine Learning Project.
Did you want to check out my Project report straight away?
It's here, in this [HTML file][3].

The files here were forked from [ud120-projects][1], the starter code
of the Udacity's class [UD-120 "Introduction to Machine Learning"][2].
As I completed the class, I added code and in the end, my final project:

* folder "final_project" contains the final project code - check out the
[README.md file there][4] to get an overview 
* the ["Data_Analyst_*.html"][3] and "Data_Analyst_*.Rmd" contain the
final project report
* folders "00_\*" through "13_\*" contain code of the lesson mini-quizzes
* folders without names contain the problem sets
